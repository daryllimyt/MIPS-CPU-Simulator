make simulator

**To compile testbench (tb.cpp) into bin folder**

make testbench

**To run simulator on testbench (skeleton)**

bin/mips_testbench bin/mips_simulator

**Exit codes**
Arithmetic exception (-10) : Any kind of arithmetic problem, such as overflow, divide by zero, ...

Memory exception (-11) : Any problem relating to memory, such as address out of range, writing to read-only memory, reading from an address that cannot be read, executing an address that cannot be executed ...
